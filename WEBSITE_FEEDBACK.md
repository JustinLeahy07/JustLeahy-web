# Website Review

## General Thoughts
- The homepage immediately communicates your name and focus areas, but most of the intro copy is hidden on mobile, so first impressions on small screens rely heavily on the hero image.
- The navigation is simple and clean, with clear destinations for portfolio, research, and about content.
- Photography is front-and-center, and the overall aesthetic feels consistent with an outdoors/conservation theme.
- The color palette and typography feel calm and approachable, and the dark mode support is a nice touch.

## Suggestions for Improvement
- **Boost the mobile hero copy.** Surface at least one line of introductory text on small screens so mobile visitors immediately know who you are and what you do.
- **Strengthen accessibility.** Add descriptive alt text to key images (e.g., the homepage hero) and include a skip link for keyboard users to jump past navigation.
- **Optimize head tags.** Consolidate duplicate meta and link tags in `index.html` and add a meta description to improve SEO and social sharing.
- **Unify navigation behavior.** Ensure dropdowns and hover effects work consistently on touch devices (consider explicit buttons for expanding sections on mobile).
- **Clarify calls to action.** Add visible links to featured projects or a contact option near the hero so visitors have an obvious next step.
